# Home-Valuation

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the worth of a house. This can aid both the buyers and sellers of houses in making a well informed decision. The dataset contains house data of different Indian cities. Notebook contains code that covers profiling, data cleansing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model training, and hyper-parameter tuning. We find the best prediction model among all the regression models in the ML pipeline.
